Conway Constant
===============
In mathematics, the Conway Constant (Look and say sequence) is the sequence of integers beginning as follows:
1, 
11, 
21, 
1211, 
111221, 
312211, 
13112221 ... (sequence A005150 in the OEIS).
To generate a member of the sequence from the previous member, read off the digits of the previous member, counting the number of digits in groups of the same digit.
