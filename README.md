Conway constant
===============
In mathematics, the Conway constant is the sequence of integers beginning as follows:
1
11
21
1211
111221
312211
13112221... (sequence A005150 in the OEIS).

To generate a member of the sequence from the previous member, read off the digits of the previous member, counting the number of digits in groups of the same digit.
